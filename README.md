Hello, this project is a visual helper tool designed to simplify the understanding of NewsAPI's documentation. While building a React.js project that displays news articles based on user input using NewsAPI, I realized that exploring all the possible use cases through the official documentation was time-consuming and not very beginner-friendly. Even experienced developers can spend several hours figuring out the complete range of query options. To solve this, I created a web-based interface that visually represents each major functionality of NewsAPI in a clear and structured way. This tool significantly reduces the time needed to grasp how NewsAPI works — from hours to just 10–15 minutes. Though this project focuses specifically on NewsAPI, it lays the foundation for a broader idea: building GUI-based tools for understanding other commonly used APIs like OpenAI, Gemini, or Weather APIs, especially helpful in hackathons, fast-paced development, or while learning.
